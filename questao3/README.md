Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with an even-valued grandparent. If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.

A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists.

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.

Example 2:
